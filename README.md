DEX Course Homework Repository
Overview
This repository contains the homework assignments for the DEX (DevOps Experts) course. It includes commands used, screenshots of terminal output, and explanations of each step to help track and review your assignments.

Contents
Commands Used: Detailed list of commands and scripts executed.
Screenshots: Visual evidence of terminal output and working directories.
Step-by-Step Explanations: Comprehensive explanations of each step performed.
Commands Used
Here, you will find a list of commands used throughout the assignments. For each task, include relevant commands and their purpose.

Example Commands
bash
Copy code
# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/homework/{dir1,dir2,dir3}

# Create files
touch ~/homework/dir1/{file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt}
Adding Content
To add content to multiple files, we used a loop command to automate the process. This method is efficient for handling multiple files with similar content.

Example Command
bash
Copy code
for i in {1..3}; do
  echo "This is the content for file$i" > ~/homework/dir1/file$i.txt
done
Explanation
Command Breakdown:

for i in {1..3}; do: This starts a loop that iterates from 1 to 3.
echo "This is the content for file$i" > ~/homework/dir1/file$i.txt: Within each iteration, this command writes content specific to each file (e.g., file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt). The variable $i is replaced by the current number in the loop.
done: This ends the loop.
Purpose:

This loop automates the creation of files and adds different content to each file. It reduces redundancy and ensures consistency when dealing with multiple files.

Step-by-Step Explanations
Provide detailed explanations of each step performed in the homework. Explain why each command was used and what it accomplishes.

Example Explanation
Creating Directories:

Command: mkdir -p ~/homework/{dir1,dir2,dir3}
Explanation: This command creates a directory structure under ~/homework with subdirectories dir1, dir2, and dir3. The -p option ensures that parent directories are created as needed.
Creating Files:

Command: touch ~/homework/dir1/{file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt}
Explanation: This command creates three text files in the dir1 directory.
Adding Content:

Command: for i in {1..3}; do echo "This is the content for file$i" > ~/homework/dir1/file$i.txt; done
Explanation: This loop command automates the process of adding content to multiple files. It iterates over a range and writes specific content to each file based on the iteration number.
