			Command: mkdir -p ~/homework/{dir1,dir2,dir3}
			
			Explanation: This command creates a directory structure under ~/homework with subdirectories dir1, dir2, and dir3. 
			The -p option ensures that parent directories are created as needed.
			
			# Creating Files:
			
			Command: touch ~/homework/dir1/{file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt}
			
			Explanation: This command creates three text files in the dir1 directory.
			
			# Adding Content:
			
			Command: for i in {1..3}; do echo "This is the content for file$i" > ~/homework/dir1/file$i.txt; done
